# HorseRace
A simple horse race game using timer. Thanks to Murat Yücedağ. I write it according to his tutorial in his youtube channel 
(https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hpNxzmHEcH4&list=PLKnjBHu2xXNPkeQtMOJczzEO6LK5OV35K&index=11). I modified it and added some extra futures.
In program gifts move from left to rigth and there are somme comments according the position of horses.
